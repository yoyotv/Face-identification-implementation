# Face-identification-Raspberry-pi


## Approach 

Using the caffe engine to extract the feature.

Combined with the c++ in order to implement an application on Raspberry-pi identify the face.

It is able to switch the model to increase the performance. e.g. Resnet, Mobilenet.

Here is the flow chart.

## GET started

You have to install

1. [Opencv](https://opencv.org/)  for read image and detect face, I use 2.4.9

2.  [Caffe](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) for extracting the feature. There is a good step by step [tutorial](https://github.com/leo2105/Caffe-installation-Raspberry-Pi-3)  to install caffe on Raspberry by leo2105

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
  ```Shell
  # Make sure to clone with --recursive
  git clone https://github.com/yoyotv/Raspberry-implementation.git
  ```
2. Replace the original caffe/tools/extract_feature.cpp with the new extract_feature.cpp file

3. Add the face_id fold under caffe/models

4. Place fold "Face_identification_Raspberry_pi" under Desktop

5. Finished!

## Tutorial

#### We can enjoy the face identification system in just one command!

1. First of all, run

```
sh Desktop/Face_identification_Raspberry_pi/run.sh
```
2. Shell will compile evaluate.cpp and detect.cpp, after that it will create two folders named Record and Current, respectively.

3. Shell then enable the detect application, the detected face will be store at folder "Current".

4. Caffe engine reads the face and extracts the feature then store it at caffe/models/face_id/features.

5. Evaluate application compare the L2 distance between the database and the feature.

6. If the system identified the face successfully, the log in information and the face will be recorded into log.txt and fold "Record", respectively.

7. Whether the system identified the face successfully or not, the system will go back to 3.


## Switch the extraction model 

1. Place the caffemodel under caffe/models/face_id/

2. Change the command in "run.sh"
```
e.g.  change
./build/tools/extract_features.bin /home/pi/caffe/models/face_id/caffe_mobilenet_without_mirror_train_iter_220000.caffemodel /home/pi/caffe/models/face_id/val.prototxt pool6 /home/pi/caffe/models/face_id/features 1 txt
```
```
into
 ./build/tools/extract_features.bin /home/pi/caffe/models/face_id/name_of_model.caffemodel /home/pi/caffe/models/face_id/val.prototxt pool6 /home/pi/caffe/models/face_id/features 1 txt
```

* If you change the model, remember the dimension of feature might be changed. In this repository, the model is mobilenet_v1 with alpha=0.25, so the dimension will be 256.

* Open evaluate.cpp and modify the variable "feature_dim" and variable "model" at line 14,15, respectively.

* The name of variable "model" in evaluate.cpp refer to the folder name in folder database, if the dimension has changed because of the caffemodel, the database will also be changed. How to add new data into database or generate database will be mentioned in "Add new data into database"

## Add new data into database

1. If you wanna add new data into database, just enable the system and let system take a photo and copy the pool6.txt which is the feature file under caffe/models/face_id/features to Face_identification_Raspberry_pi/database/your_model_name/

## Example for Switch the extraction model and Add new data into database

1. I wanna change the model to [Resnet_50](https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks/blob/master/prototxt/ResNet-50-deploy.prototxt) and store the feature of somenoe which extracted from Resnet_50 as the database.

2. Changed the command of line 14 in run.sh to 
```./build/tools/extract_features.bin /home/pi/caffe/models/face_id/caffe_Resnet_50.caffemodel /home/pi/caffe/models/face_id/val.prototxt pool6 /home/pi/caffe/models/face_id/features 1 txt```
 
3. Place the Resnet_50.caffemodel under caffe/models/face_id/

4. Open evaluate.cpp and modify the const variable "feature_dim" and "model" to 2048 and "Resnet_50", respectively.

5. Place caffe/models/face_id/features/pool6.txt under Face_identification_Raspberry_pi/database/Resnet_50/.

## Demo

* The performance of model "mobilenet_0.25" is not good, it is trained by [CASIA-webface](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.7923.pdf). The top-1 accurancy is only 72%. In the demo video, the L2 distance between different database face is closed. 

* The L2 distance will be more significant if change the model to e.g. Resnet.

## Anything else?

* Train more models to play.

* Train the model with AM-softmax so that we could evaluate the angle between faces to identify person.
