# Face-identification-Raspberry-pi


## Approach 

Using the caffe engine to extract the feature.

Combined with the c++ in order to implement an application on Raspberry-pi to identify the face.

It is able to switch the model to increase the performance. e.g. Resnet, Mobilenet.

Here is the flow chart.

## GET started

You have to install

1. [Opencv](https://opencv.org/)  for read image and detect face, I use 2.4.9

2.  [Caffe](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) for extracting the feature. There is a good step by step [tutorial](https://github.com/leo2105/Caffe-installation-Raspberry-Pi-3)  to install caffe on Raspberry by leo2105
