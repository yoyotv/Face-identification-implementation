# Face-identification-Raspberry-pi


## Approach 

Using the caffe engine to extract the feature.

Combined with the c++ in order to implement an application on Raspberry-pi identify the face.

It is able to switch the model to increase the performance. e.g. Resnet, Mobilenet.

Here is the flow chart.

## GET started

You have to install

1. [Opencv](https://opencv.org/)  for read image and detect face, I use 2.4.9

2.  [Caffe](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) for extracting the feature. There is a good step by step [tutorial](https://github.com/leo2105/Caffe-installation-Raspberry-Pi-3)  to install caffe on Raspberry by leo2105

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
  ```Shell
  # Make sure to clone with --recursive
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/yoyotv/Raspberry.git
  ```
2. Replace the original caffe/tools/extract_feature.cpp with the new extract_feature.cpp file

3. Add the face_id fold under caffe/models

4. Place fold "Face_identification_Raspberry_pi" under Desktop

5. Finished!

## Tutorial

1. First of all, run ```sh run.sh```
